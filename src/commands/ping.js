According to relativity, the speed of light is a constant (denoted as 'c') in all inertial frames of reference. This means that no matter how fast the source emitting light is traveling, light always appears to move away from it at the same speed.

As you approach the speed of light in your car, the light emitted from the headlights would still travel at 'c' relative to you. However, for an outside observer, the combined speed of the car and the light would not exceed 'c'. This is due to a phenomenon known as time dilation, in which time appears to slow down for observers moving relative to one another at high speeds.

From the perspective of an outside observer, the light emitted from the car's headlights would still move away from the car at 'c'. However, the light waves themselves would appear more compressed, or "blueshifted," as a result of the Doppler effect. This means that the observer would perceive the light as having a higher frequency, shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum.

Moreover, due to length contraction, the distance between the headlights would appear shortened in the direction of motion. This contraction would cause the headlights to appear closer together, contributing to an even greater blueshift in the light emitted.

To summarize, if you were able to drive your car close to the speed of light and turn on the headlights, an outside observer would witness highly blueshifted light emitted from the headlights, possibly shifting into the ultraviolet or even gamma-ray frequencies.If you were able to drive a car close to the speed of light, the behavior of light, as described by Einstein's theory of relativity, would have some intriguing consequences.
